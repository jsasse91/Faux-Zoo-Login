Welcome to my week 13 project which is my introduction to using React. This project uses: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. 

The contents of this project are (as of typing this): 1 CSS file (App.css), 1 favicon (favicon.ico), 1 HTML file (index.html), 1 JPEG file (Zebra.jpeg), 3 JavaScript files (Login.js, Nav.js, and index.js). 

Thank you for reading this.
